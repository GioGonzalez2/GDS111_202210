    <h2>My Bio</h2>

    <img src="images/Vault Boy.jfif" alt="Fallout" style="width: 500px;">

    <p>My name is <strong> Giovanni Gonzalez </strong>and I was born in Brooklyn New York. It didn't take long for my parents to move to Rhode Island because they relized we weren't living in the best neighborhood to raise a child. I grew up in Johnston most of my life and didn't get to take up many exciting hobbies because there wasn't a lot to do. Video games became my biggest interest, not only because it was fun but it also allowed me keep up with old friends from New York. </p><br> <br>
    <p>I'm enrolled here at NEIT so i can continue to pursue that passion I have for gaming. A family friend went here not too long ago and recommended it to me so I decided to give it a shot. So far I've been very happy with my decision and I'm hopeful for my future here. That's about all the storytelling I had left in me so enjoy! </p>
