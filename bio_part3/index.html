            <p class="bio">My name is Giovanni Gonzalez and I was born in Brooklyn New York. It didn't take long for my parents to move to Rhode Island because they relized we weren't living in the best neighborhood to raise a child. I grew up in Johnston most of my life and didn't get to take up many exciting hobbies because there wasn't a lot to do. Video games became my biggest interest, not only because it was fun but it also allowed me keep up with old friends from New York.</p>
